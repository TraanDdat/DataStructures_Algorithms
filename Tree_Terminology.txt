*Tree Terminology in Data Structures

- Tree

A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with one designated root.

- Node

The fundamental unit of a tree, stores data and possibly links to child nodes.

- Root

The topmost node of the tree.

A tree has exactly one root (unless empty).

- Edge

A connection between a parent and a child node.

- Parent

A node that has one or more children.

-Child

A node that descends from a parent.

- Sibling

Nodes that share the same parent.

- Leaf (External Node)

A node with no children.

- Internal Node

Any node that is not a leaf (has at least one child).

- Ancestor

Any node on the path from the root to a given node.

- Descendant

A node that lies below another node in the hierarchy.

- Path

A sequence of nodes connected by edges.

- Level (Depth)

Distance from the root to the node (root = level 0).

- Height of Node

Longest path (in edges) from the node to a leaf.

- Height of Tree

Height of the root node (longest root-to-leaf path).

- Depth of Node

Number of edges from the root to that node.

- Degree of Node

Number of children of a node.

- Degree of Tree

The maximum degree of any node in the tree.

- Subtree

A tree formed from any node and its descendants.

- Binary Tree

A tree where each node has at most 2 children (left, right).

- Full Binary Tree

Every node has either 0 or 2 children.

- Complete Binary Tree

All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.

- Perfect Binary Tree

All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaves are at the same level.

- Balanced Tree

A tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees of every node is bounded (e.g., AVL Tree).

- Forest

A collection of disjoint trees.

* Example Tree
        A (root)
       / \
      B   C
     / \    \
    D   E    F
   / \
  G   H

Root: A

Parent of B: A

Children of B: D, E

Siblings: B and C

Descendants of B: D, E, G, H 

Leaf nodes: D, E, F

Internal nodes: A, B, C

External nodes: G, H, E, F

Ancestors: Path from A to E: A → B → E

Height of tree: 3

Depth( Level ) of E: 2

Degree of B: 2
