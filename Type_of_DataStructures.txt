* Physical: Refer to "How data is actually stored in memory". It's about the "organization" and "arrangement" of data in memory.
    - Array --> Store in "stack" memory
        + Pros: Fast access by index (O(1))
        + Cons: Fixed size, costly inserts/deletions in the middle
    - Linked List --> Store in "heap" memory
        + Pros: Dynamic size, easily insert/delete
        + Cons: Slower access (O(n) for searching)

* Logical: 
    - Linear:
        - Stack --> LiFo
        - Queues --> FiFo
    - Non-Linear
        - Tree 
        - Graph
    - Tabular
        - Hash Table
